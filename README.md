# Discord.py-Kick-No-Role-Command
This is a simple command in discord.py that kicks everyone in a server with no role. Everyone already has the @everyone role, so it will only kick users with @everyone. (E.g. ImCool with roles Mod and @everyone won't be kicked, but ImNotCool with only @everyone will be kicked).
